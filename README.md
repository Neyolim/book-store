# Book Store

**Book Store** is a MERN stack project demonstrating the full-stack flow: **MongoDB → Express → React → Node**.

It’s a simple CRUD app for books (list, view, create, edit, delete) with a clean, minimal UI built using **Vite** and **Tailwind CSS**.

The project showcases the end-to-end workflow: how backend routes interact with the database and how the frontend consumes these APIs.

## Stuff I covered while building this

- Backend CRUD with **Express** + **Mongoose**
- Express routing
- CORS setup so the frontend (Vite) can communicate with the backend during development
- Frontend CRUD flow with **React**, **Vite**, **axios**, and **react-router-dom**
- Minimal, responsive UI built with **Tailwind CSS**

## Tech Stack

**Backend:** Node.js, Express, Mongoose (MongoDB Atlas), CORS, nodemon (dev)  
**Frontend:** React (Vite), Tailwind CSS, axios, react-router-dom, react-icons
